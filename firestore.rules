/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the inventory system.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows read and write access to any authenticated user. Since the application does not specify user-specific data or roles, the rules are open to all authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into five top-level collections: /blocks/{blockId}, /sectors/{sectorId}, /rooms/{roomId}, /assets/{assetId}, and /movements/{movementId}. There are no nested collections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All authenticated users can read and write to all collections.
 * - There are no specific authorization requirements outlined besides basic authentication, so more granular access control is not implemented.
 * - No denormalization for authorization independence is required.
